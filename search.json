"content"  : "This theme was created using the Google’s Polymer 1.0. It’s currently a first draft, so there are still features I plan to add and fix. (See the Github repository for details.)I created this theme because I couldn’t figure out how to set up a Jekyll project to play nicely with Polymer, and because I didn’t find any Jekyll blog themes available that used Polymer or followed Google’s material design specifications.Structure  elements/: Custom web components using Polymer  scripts/: Javascript. Will be minimized when built.  styles/: Custom CSS. CSS used here will be minimized when built.  bower_components: Content installed via bower goes here  node_modules: Content installed via npm goes hereBuild InstructionsThis part is pretty brutal right now but gets the job done. Hopefully I’ll get better with gulp and clean this up soon.For now, just use Jekyll to build and serve. The gulp stuff doesn’t really work yet."

This is a block quote.It’s split over multiple lines.  It can also have multiple paragraphs.Math (with MathJax)You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using MathJax, as on math.stackexchange.com:There are inline equations like ( y = x + 2 ) indicated by ( ... ).You can also display an equation (not inline displayed) using inline code, like [ y = x + 4] which you do with [ ... ].Or you can display a block of math by surrounding it with $$ ... $$. Like this:  Tip: Make sure you include MathJax into your publications to render mathematical expression correctly. Your page/template should include something like:&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://stackedit.io/libs/MathJax/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;CodeInline codeCode embedded in a paragraph looks like this is code. Code can also be in blocks with or without line numbers.Code blocks (fenced code)Code blocks have syntax highlighting courtesy of highlight.js. You can specify the code language and whether you want the code block to include line numbers. (You can include line numbers using just linenos instead of linenos=table, but this puts the line numbers in the same lines as the code so that it becomes impossible to copy and paste.)With line numbers (as table):12345  def print_hi(name)    puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;  end  print_hi(&#39;Tom&#39;)  #=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.

"url"      : "/jekyll-polymer/2014/12/15/shiny-matlab-figures-exporting.html",
"date"     : "2014 December 15",
"content"  : "So far in our quest to make better Matlab figures, we’ve looked at an alternative way to draw error bars and adjusting parameters to make figures more readable. Last (for now) but not least: how to best get those figures out of Matlab and into the real world. There are some built-in methods, but I’ve found they don’t work quite as well as an alternative from the Matlab File Exchange.A note on all of these: The figures were exported without resizing the figure window, which is how I make my figures unless I have a compelling reason to change the aspect ratio or size. If you scale the window size, your lines and fonts will be smaller relative to the graph.##PNGThe simplest method is to directly save the figure as a PNG file with the save button or command line. (Note: never use JPEG for graphics like this. JPEGs are compressed and the edges and borders in the image will look bad). This is the result:You’ll notice, though, that the edges and text look somewhat choppy because the output has no anti-aliasing. Also, sometimes the x-axis label is cut off, as happened here. And last but not least, you can’t do any refinements or editing of the image after it’s created.##EPSThe next option is to save the figure in an editable vector format. Matlab will let you directly save EPS files for this purpose. Here’s the result if we save as EPS, then open the file in Inkscape (for editing) and export as a PNG from there:This looks pretty much the same as the PNG, with the same problems! Why? Because EPS files don’t support transparency and our figure includes a patch with transparency, Matlab exports the entire thing as a raster (pixel-based) image embedded in the EPS. So we’ve gained nothing. EPS works OK if you have a figure without transparency, but the files are a little strange (such as poor letter spacing) and hard to work with in my preferred, free vector editor of Inkscape.##SVGWhich brings us to the final and (in my opinion) best way to export images: plot2svg. It’s available for download on the Matlab File Exchange. Simply download the file, add it to your path in Matlab, and call plot2svg. It will save the current figure as an SVG, which is a more advanced vector file format that supports things like transparency and is really easy to work with in Inkscape. Here’s the result when exported as a PNG from Inkscape:That’s one shiny-looking graph. Making adjustments to the graph like fonts, labels, and combining graphs becomes really easy working with SVG files. Plus, you can do things like export them as PNGs of any size or export them as scalable PDFs to embed in a document.The worst “export” of a Matlab graph I’ve seen was a screen capture of the Matlab window copied and pasted onto a poster. Now you can feel snooty about how ridiculously awesome your figures look in comparison."

"content"  : "In my never-ending quest to create decent-looking graphs with Matlab, one challenge is the default parameters for figures, particularly in terms of font size and line thickness. These defaults look alright for looking at the figures yourself to figure out what’s going on. But if you want to export them to use in a presentation, poster, or paper, the lines are too thin and the fonts too small. Using the same data generation as in my previous post, it looks something like this:That comes from this little bit of Matlab code:% Plotting with default settingslegend_labels = {&#39;Square Root Growth&#39;, &#39;Linear Growth&#39;};figurehold ontitle(&#39;Plot with default values&#39;)xlabel(&#39;Percent Complete&#39;)ylabel(&#39;Arbitrary Values&#39;)plot(x_vals, data_mean, &#39;b&#39;)plot(x_vals, data2_mean, &#39;r&#39;)legend(legend_labels)I mean, that figure doesn’t look bad, but this looks a lot slicker:There are a few modifications to the defaults I’ve figured out along the way to come to this, so that this figure comes from:% Graphically refined plottingfont_size = 16;title_size = 20;legend_labels = {&#39;Square Root Growth&#39;, &#39;Linear Growth&#39;};figureset(gca, &#39;Box&#39;, &#39;off&#39;, ... % Remove outline for top/right of graph        &#39;FontSize&#39;, font_size, ... % Set size of tick and axis labels        &#39;LineWidth&#39;, 2) % Set width of axes to 2hold ontitle(&#39;Graphically refined plotting&#39;, &#39;FontSize&#39;, title_size, &#39;FontWeight&#39;, &#39;bold&#39;)xlabel(&#39;Percent Complete&#39;, &#39;FontWeight&#39;, &#39;Bold&#39;)ylabel(&#39;Arbitrary Values&#39;, &#39;FontWeight&#39;, &#39;Bold&#39;)plot(x_vals, data_mean, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;LineWidth&#39;, 2)plot(x_vals, data2_mean, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;LineWidth&#39;, 2)legend(legend_labels, &#39;Location&#39;, &#39;NorthWest&#39;)legend(&#39;boxoff&#39;)Let’s go through each of the pieces here.  Font sizes: By setting variables for the title and font sizes, it’s easier to make them consistent (and modify them) for multiple figures produced in a file. I’ve found 16 and 20 pt fonts to work well.  set(gca, ...): This sets a couple of parameters for the current set of axes. The ‘Box’ ensures that there no lines are placed on the top and right sides of the figure. Without this, they’ll show up in some (but not all!) figures. I think it looks nicer without them. ‘FontSize’ makes use of the variable set above to change the size of text for axes labels and legends. Setting the ‘LineWidth’ will make the axes and tick marks thicker, but doesn’t set the thickness of the lines in the plots.  Title and Labels: Here you manually set the size of the title and make the labels bold. It just makes things stand out better.  &#39;LineWidth&#39;: You have to manually set the line thickness for every plot you make.  Legend: In the first figure, the legend hid part of the data. However, legends can be re-positioned (take a look at ‘Location’ in the legend properties documentation). I also got rid of the box (and background) of the legend, which I think just looks ugly.Just like with plotting the error bars as patches, this takes a little more work and code. The result once again, though, is much nicer-looking, professional graphs that are much easier for your audience to actually read."

"content"  : "I make a lot of Matlab figures. That’s an occupational hazard of being the undergraduate in a research lab, I suppose. Over the past few years, though, the graphically-conscious side of me has gotten annoyed at the terrible Matlab figures I’ve seen on posters and even in papers. I have also come up with my own tricks to create really gorgeous Matlab figures. Over the next few posts, I’ll share a couple of them with you, including:  Plotting error with patches instead of error bars  Changing default figure drawing parameters and sizing  Exporting figuresLet’s start with the first one: error bars. Error bars are great when you have a few data points, but when you have more continuous data, it gets messy and hard to tell what’s going on, like this:This is created using a pretty simple script in Matlab. The data is generated pseudo-randomly:% Generate pseudo-random datanum_data_points = 25;data = rand(10, num_data_points);for i=1:size(data, 2)    data(:,i) = data(:,i)*i^.5;end% x valuesx_max = 100;% Calculate mean and standard deviation of datadata_mean = mean(data,1);data_std = std(data,0,1);Then it’s plotted with a few lines of code using the errorbar function:% Plotting error with errorbarfigureerrorbar(x_vals, data_mean, data_std, &#39;LineWidth&#39;, 2)title(&#39;Plot error with errorbar&#39;)xlim([0 x_max])However, I’ve discovered that using the patch function in Matlab can create much more visually appealing and easier to interpret graphs like this:This requires some additional code:% Plotting error with patchesfigurehold ontitle(&#39;Plot error with patch&#39;)xlim([0 x_max])% Loop the x values back to the startpatch_x_vals = [x_vals, x_vals(end:-1:1)];% Create the data+std and data-std valuespatch_data_std = [data_mean-data_std, data_mean(end:-1:1)+data_std(end:-1:1)]; plot(x_vals, data_mean, &#39;LineWidth&#39;, 2)patch(patch_x_vals, patch_data_std, [0 0 1], &#39;EdgeColor&#39;, &#39;None&#39;, &#39;FaceAlpha&#39;, 0.4);The patch is drawn as a polygon, starting on the left with the lower bound, then reversing direction to draw the upper bound of the error from right to left. The arguments to patch after this specify the face color, edge color, and transparency.This relatively minimal addition can make your plots much easier to read, particularly if you’re dealing with multiple data sets at the same time where error bars would overlap and be nearly impossible to distinguish."

"content"  : "An Awesomely Useful Thing: Google KeepI am in constant search of something easy to serve as an external memory for everything I have to do and remember. A list on a piece of paper? Great until you misplace or forget the paper. An app? I thought I’d tried them all: ToDoist, Wunderlist, you name it. ToDoist is nice for individual tasks, but groups of things and notes to myself got complicated fast and I found that I wasn’t actually using it. It did have cross-system support, so I could use it in Chrome and on my iPad and Android phone. That was the major shortfall of many other apps I tried: if I don’t have my phone or computer, I still need my external memory.Then I discovered that Google has its own feature, and I’m surprised that I had never heard of it: Google Keep. Since I am already fully integrated into the Google ecosystem, it fits fantastically with everything else I already use, too. Here’s how it works:##Create NotesYou can make lists, checkbox lists, text, audio, or image notes to keep track of anything you need to. I have a grocery list, a list of things to do at work, and movies I want to watch, for example. These notes all show up on the keep website that you can drag to organize, recolor, and archive when you’re done. Plus, you can add an image to any note. I’m not a fan of most of the colors for the notes (they’re a bit bright for black text), but the whole thing uses Google’s great new Material design and is really slick overall. When you’re done, you can also archive notes instead of deleting them, in case you ever need to go back and check it in the future.##Share NotesYou can share notes. Now you can make blame your roommate for not picking up more milk.##Remind YourselfYou can also set reminders for your notes, by time or place, so you don’t forget what to do when or where you need to do it.##See it EverywhereOne of the most useful features of Keep is that it has a nice web interface, Android app, and iOS app. Creating, organizing, and handling notes is straight forward in all of them without unnecessary distractions. Bonus: there’s a widget for Android, too. Because it’s all connected to your Google account, all of your notes are synced and instantly accessible anywhere you’re logged into Google - no installation necessary.##OverallHaving some way to group or sort notes would be a great additional feature, but even without that it’s a great tool. I’d also like to see integration with reminders in the new Inbox, but that might come with time. Overall, Google Keep is the most painless way I have found to keep my thoughts in control: full-featured without being overwhelming, free and ad-free, and effectively cross-platform."

I explain how to get a bunch of options in [this post](/jekyll-polymer/2014/09/10/how-to-make-drracket-more-pleasant-looking.html  Go to Edit &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Editing &amp;gt; General and check the box for “Enable automatic parentheses.” It automatically closes your parentheses and makes your life a lot easier.  In the same tab, also check “Show line numbers”  Instead of writing out lambda all the time, you can use a keyboard shortcut to get the character λ. It’s Ctrl + .  Fix code indentation for a section by highlighting it and pressing Tab.  Fix indentation for your entire file with Ctrl + I.  You can right click on any function name to search for it in the help desk.  You can change the default browser for opening documentation under Edit &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Browser.  To prevent a zillion windows from opening, go to Edit &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; General and check “Open files in separate tabs”  When working with large programs the program contour is nice for navigating within the file.

Just fire up a terminal and run:raco pkg install git://github.com/tuirgin/base16-drracketWhen you restart DrRacket and go to Edit &amp;gt; Preferences, the themes should all show up in the Colors tab.I’m currently using one of my favorite themes, Monokai Dark, with the slight modification of setting the “Basic gray parenthesis highlight color” to #3E3D32 (slightly darker than the default).Now you have one less excuse to not be doing your programming homework."

"content"  : "It used to be super easy to set Gmail to send mail as another email address. It recently (as in, this month) became a lot harder, since Gmail now doesn’t let you automatically use its SMTP servers. If that last sentence didn’t make sense, don’t worry. I’ll walk you through how to set it up step by step. To start out, I assume that you already have email forwarding set up so that your custom email (say, me@example.com) gets sent to your gmail (which we’ll call example@gmail.com).  You must have 2-step authentication set up for you Google account. If not, when you try to log in later, you’ll get an authentication failure, and then an email about a suspicious log in attempt.  Once you have 2-step authentication set up, you need a specific app password that you’ll use for setting up the email sending.From any Google page, click on your user picture in upper right corner and select Account. From the Account page, select the Security tab. In the Password box, click Settings next to App Passwords. On the dropdown menu that says Select app, choose Other (custom name). Type in any name you like (I went with Gmail SMTP) and click Generate. Copy the new password.  Now we can actually set this up! From your Gmail page, click the cog icon on the right side and select Settings. Go to the Accounts and Imports tab. In the Send mail as section, click Add another email address you own. In the window that pops up, put in the email address you want to send as (me@example.com) and click Next Step. (Go ahead and change the name and alias settings however you want.) On the next page, enter the information as follows:          SMTP Server: smtp.gmail.com      Port: 465      Username: Your full gmail address, like example@gmail.com      Password: The password you generated and copied in Step 2      Secured Connection ussing SSL (Change the radio button to select this option)        Then click Add Account. An email should show up in your inbox, which you can click to verify the email address. Now, if you go to Accounts and Import in your settings, you should see the new email address.That’s more of a pain than it used to be, and more than it should be, but it is still possible to send email from Gmail using your own custom email address.

Then click the “Dashboard” option on the right side, scroll down to “Text Editor” and select Markdown. You can check out all of the awesome output that Markdown produces with this cheatsheet.One bonus of Markdown that I’ve discovered is that it’s really great for easily incorporating code into normal-text documents. There are 3 way to do this:##Inline code:Type this:I put some `code` in my text.Get this output:I put some code in my text.##Code blocks:Type this: (with 4 spaces at the beginning of the line).   This is a block        with multiple lines of code.        Ta-da!Get this output:This is a block    with multiple lines of code.

Or do you, like me, often lose your spot when there is a ton of output and you can’t tell where it started?Whatever the reason, you might want to change up the way the bash prompt looks in your terminal. As it turns out, there’s a simple, awesome tool to help you do that. There’s an interactive GUI to change color, boldnes, and insert text. It will even show you a live preview of what your prompt will look like.Below that on the page, there are a few lines of code to add this customization to your terminal. If you just want to try it out before finalizing, you can just copy and paste the PS1=…….. portion into your terminal. When you finalized what you want, open your bashrc file with nano ~/.bashrc and paste that entire block of code at the bottom. Then restart your terminal to make sure everything worked.The command prompt customization is user-specific, which has a bunch of benefits: it will show up when you SSH into your user, it will show up no matter what terminal you use, and it lets you distinguish between users (so you don’t accidentally do everything as root, for example).Currently, here’s what mine looks like (copy and paste into your terminal to check it out):PS1=&quot;[$(tput bold)][$(tput setaf 2)]nu@h: [$(tput setaf 7)]w[$(tput setaf 3)]n$ [$(tput sgr0)]&quot;"

"content"  : "I just started working with Django and wanted to create a really basic user authentication system. According to the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle, I didn’t want to rewrite Django’s built-in login system and end up creating an inferior version. But I also couldn’t find any good examples of how to do this. After lots of Google and StackOverflow, here’s what I came up with.First, set up the url for the login page. Add the following to your project’s urls.py:from django.conf.urls import patterns, urlfrom django.views.generic import RedirectViewurlpatterns = patterns(&#39;&#39;,    # ...    url(r&#39;^login/$&#39;, &#39;django.contrib.auth.views.login&#39;),    url(r&#39;^accounts/profile/$&#39;, RedirectView.as_view(url=&#39;/&#39;)),    url(r&#39;^logout/$&#39;, &#39;django.contrib.auth.views.logout_then_login&#39;),    # ...)The first URL sets /login/ as the login page and uses Django’s built-in login view (which takes care of all of the authentication and error messages).After logging in with the built-in login view, the user is automatically redirected to /accounts/profile/. But with the 2nd URL, you don’t have to worry about setting that up. Instead, the user is automatically redirected to the URL you specify. (In this case, that’s set to the home page.)The 3rd URL is used to log a user out. Going to /logout/ automatically logs the user out and redirects them to the login page. This means all you have to do is have a link to the URL /logout and the rest of the work is all done for you! (You can also use the logout view, but this is the easiest place to start, I think.)With any of these, you can change the URLs to whatever you please.From these URLs, the only page you now have to create is the log in screen. You don’t have to add anything to any views.py, because you’re using a built-in view. All you have to write is the template. Create the file my_project/registration/login.html and put in it:&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Log In&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;form method=&quot;post&quot; action=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;    {% csrf_token %}    {{ form.as_p }}    &amp;lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Log in&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;This will display a simple form with fields for the username and password and a submit button. Errors are automatically generated and displayed if the user enters an invalid username/password combination or leaves either of the fields blank. When the user clicks “Log in”, they’re redirected to the URL you specified above.Let’s say that you now want to protect pages so that only logged in users can view them. That’s pretty easy now. Just add the tag @login_required above any view where a user needs to be logged in. And what if they aren’t logged in? They should be re-directed to the login page. To specify what that page is, add this line to your project’s settings.py:LOGIN_URL = &#39;/login&#39;Or whatever URL you chose above as your login page URL. After logging in, the user will be automatically taken back to whatever page they were kicked off of for not being logged in, which is pretty cool.Lastly, you can also style the login page or embed it into a larger template for your project. The trick with this is knowing what the generated HTML elements are in order to style them. I figured it out by inspecting the elements in my browser on that page. Here are a few useful ones:Generated errors: &amp;lt;ul class=&quot;errorlist&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Error&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;Username field: &amp;lt;input id=&quot;id_username&quot; maxlength=&quot;254&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;&amp;gt;Password field: &amp;lt;input id=&quot;id_password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot; type=&quot;password&quot;&amp;gt;Here’s the CSS I used to start:form .errorlist {    color: #f00;    list-style-type: none;    padding: 0;    font-style: italic;    margin: 0;    font-size: .9em;}form p {    margin-bottom: 0;}input {    border: 1px solid #999;    display: block;    background-color: #fff;    padding: .25em .5em;    width: calc(100% - 1em);}input[type=&quot;submit&quot;] {    margin-top: 1em;    width: auto;}From that, you can adjust and update, but hopefully if you’ve run across this in the chasm of the internet, I’ve saved you at least some amount of frustration."

"content"  : "I like being precise, so I use a lot of graph paper, even for writing. But recently I discovered dot paper, which provides all the precision of graph paper without all the lines!The problem?  I’m a college student who doesn’t want to spend $5 on a small notebook, and I also like loose-leaf paper.The solution?  Make grid paper myself!  (Since I have a $120 university print quota, this is also completely free.) There are templates online, but none of them quite met my specifications, so I decided to make my own in my favorite graphics program: Inkscape.So, let me explain it for people who have absolutely no Inkscape experience whatsoever.First, if you don’t have Inkscape you can get it here.      Make the page the right size    I’m assuming you’ll be printing on “normal” sized sheets of paper.    Go to File → Document Properties (or press Ctrl + Shift + D)In the section for Page Size, select “US Letter” (or A4 if you’re in Europe) and close the dialog.            Create a circle    Select the circle tool from the toolbar (or press F5 to select it).    Drag to create an ellipse (of any size) anywhere on the page.        Mouse over the bottom color bar and look for “50% Gray.” Click to set this as the fill color for the circle.    Mouse over to the far left side for the color “none.” Shift-click this to remove the circle’s outline (if it has one).            Size &amp;amp; position the circle    In the top bar, set the ellipse’s width and height to the spacing you want between your dots.    I use 5 mm. (You can change the units to the right of these boxes.)    Go to Object → Align and Distribute (or press Ctrl + Shift + A)    In the Align section, set “Relative to:” to “Page.”    Select the circle, then click for “Align left edges” and “Align top edges.” Your circle should now be in the top left corner of the page.            Make a grid of big circles    Go to Edit → Clone → Create Tiled Clones.    On the Symmetry tab, “P1: simple translation” should be selected. Set the “Width, height” to at least the size of your page. (Make sure to check the units!)        On the Shift tab, set the “Exponent” values to 1 and everything else to 0.        Make sure everything in the other tabs is set to 0 (except exponents set to 1) and boxes are unchecked.    Click “Create” to make the make the clone grid, then close the dialog.            Resize to make dots    Select the original circle (not any of the clones). It may be covered by a clone. Go ahead and delete that clone.    Back at the top of the window, change the circle’s dimensions to something small. I use 0.5 mm. Now you have a grid!            Save it for printing (PDF)    By default, Inkscape saves SVG files, which you can’t necessarily print elsewhere. Save the file as an SVG for future editing, though.    Then, go to File → Save a Copy. In the save dialog, select PDF as the file format and click Save.    In the next dialog, the default settings should be fine, so just click OK.        Printing    When you go to print, you don’t want to accidentally shrink down your grid. Most printers aren’t borderless, though, so you will have some white space margin on the edges.    When printing make sure to uncheck boxes that say something to the effect of “Shrink page to fit.”  Print out as many as you want and have at it. “It” being whatever you do with dot grid paper in your crazy world."

"content"  : "I’ve been using Ubuntu Gnome lately, but my biggest pet peeve has always been the big, fluffy title bars. This can be ameliorated a bit by shrinking the Window Titles font size (in the ‘Fonts’ section of the Gnome Tweak Tool), but the big benefit comes from reducing the padding in the title bar.This padding issue became especially important since Gnome 3.10 has moved to the header bar. By integrating the title bar and menus, it can save space… for the programs that take advantage of it. For those that don’t, the result is just a huge title bar. But that can be fixed by reducing the padding, which doesn’t damage the look of the programs using the new header bar.Open a terminal and run:sudo sed -i &quot;/title_vertical_pad/s/value=&quot;[0-9]{1,2}&quot;/value=&quot;5&quot;/g&quot; /usr/share/themes/Adwaita/metacity-1/metacity-theme-3.xmlThen press Alt + F2, type r, and hit enter to restart Gnome for the changes to take effect. This command edits /usr/share/themes/Adwaita/metacity-1/metacity-theme-3.xml to set title_vertical_pad to a value of 5.The trouble with this approach is that it shrinks down the images for the close/maximize/minimize buttons, which are designed to have a lot of padding, basically resulting in them looking like specks (but they’re still clickably-sized). There are two ways to deal with this:      Where the command says &quot;value=&quot;5&quot;, replace the 5 with padding value of your choosing. 0 will make the title bars as thin as possible, while picking a larger value makes the buttons more clickable.        Theoretically, you could also edit the theme to replace the images for the close/maximize/minimize buttons to something with less padding. However, this isn’t something I’ve tried. I know which speck is which, so for me, personally, it’s not worth trying to delve into that.  Source: Mikey’s Help Desk"
